# MovieLens Project

This repository contains all of the files created for the **MovieLens Project**
Submission. This project pertains to the **Data Science: Capstone** course, which is
the ninth and final course of the [HarvardX: Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)
series.

The completion of this course assumes that the eight previous courses were taken and
passed successfully.

This project uses the MovieLens Dataset in order to accurately predict how
much rating a movie will receive.

This is achieved through a thorough analysis section that studies each variable's behavior
and how each variable possibly affects the movie's rating itself.

A *manual approach* was used due to the large row count of the MovieLens dataset
(10 million rows). So each feature was averaged separately and later on added up
to the final model's result in order to account for that feature.

This manual approach yields an RMSE of 0.863641, a score that beats the benchmark
score to beat in order to achieve the best grade.
