# Choose Your Own Project

This repository contains all of the files created for the **Choose Your Own Project**
Submission. This project pertains to the **Data Science: Capstone** course, which is
the ninth and final course of the [HarvardX: Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)
series.

The completion of this course assumes that the eight previous courses were taken and
passed successfully.

This project uses the [Delivery Time Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gautamdeora7/food-delivery-time-a-multi-factor-dataset/data) in order to accurately predict how
much time a food order is going to take in order to get to the user's destination.

This is achieved through a thorough analysis section that studies each variable's behavior
and how each variable possibly affects the delivery time itself.

A linear regression model, as well as a random forest model are implemented in order
to predict the target variable. The best resulting model is the random forest model,
with an RMSE of 3.5.
